# Grocery Store Software System
<a href = "https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2022/project-group-group-07/wiki">Wiki Home Page</a>

## Project Overview
We are developing a website and android application for a local grocery store. The store's customers will be able to browse the all of the store's items and order online for delivery or pickup. They are also able to create an account to save their email and home address, as well as accumulate store points for rewards. The employees will be able to use the software to view their schedules and tasks. The store's owner will be able to manage their employees and modify the store's information such as its business hours and holidays.

## About us
We are a team of six Software Engineering Students in U2 at McGill. We are group 07 of Winter 2022's ECSE-321-001 class
